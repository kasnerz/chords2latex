[Verse 1]
  C       Bm7          E7              Am     Am/G
Yesterday   all my troubles seemed so far away   
F       G7                    C           C/B Am   D7       F C C
Now it looks as though they're here to stay oh I believe in yesterday
 
[Verse 2]
C        Bm7      E7             Am         Am/G
Suddenly  I'm not half the man I used to be 
F         G7             C       C/B Am   D7       F C C
 there's a shadow hanging over me oh yesterday came suddenly
 
[Chorus]
Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G F         Dm        G        C
Why she  had to   go I don't know she wouldn't say
Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G  F          Dm        G     C
I   said something wrong now I long for yesterday
 
[Verse 3]
C       Bm7         E7           Am          Am/G
Yesterday  love was such an easy game to play 
F      G7             C         C/B Am   D7      F C C
 now I need a place to hide away oh I believe in yesterday
 
[Chorus]
Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G F           Dm       G       C
 Why she  had to   go I don't know she wouldn't say
Bm7 E7   Am  Am/G  F          Dm        G     C
I   said something wrong now I long for yesterday
